# PSU Manager
This component is intended to support cold redundancy feature for PSUs.
Enabling cold redundancy will achieve better power delivery efficiency
and increase life of power supply components.

## Overview
When the power subsystem is in cold redundant mode, only required
PSUs are enabled to support the best power delivery efficiency,
other PSUs are kept in cold standby state. Cold redundancy feature
has rank configuration for PSUs to allow BMC to periodically rotate
PSUs to increase life of power supply components.

## Mode of Operations
### Automatic Cycling Redundancy Ranking :
* Rank configuration is cycled periodically to allow for equal loading across
  power supply lifetime.
* The BMC firmware provides a configurable cycling capability.
* If rotation is enabled, then BMC will periodically rotate the rank
  assignments in order to distribute the workload over the lifetime of the system
  power supplies.

### Static Redundancy Ranking
* If rotation feature is disabled, then either a user-specified or BMC
  static rank ordering will be used.
* A user-specified rank order will persist until modified or disabled by
  the user. The BMC will make a best-effort to follow the user-specified
  rank order depending on the power supply status.

## Rank Configuration
BMC reconfiguration of the cold redundancy rankings of the power supplies
shall be triggered by the following events:
* Power supply inserted or removed from the system.
* AC power restored in Power supply.
If a user-specified rank order is chosen, then the BMC will revert
to BMC static rank ordering if there is a change in the power supply
population.

## Configuration of Cold Redundancy Behavior Through IPMI
The BMC provides an OEM IPMI command that allows management software to
control the behavior of the cold redundancy feature as follows:
* Ability to turn off/on the cold redundancy feature.
* Ability to turn off/on the automatic rank cycling.
* Ability to set a specified rank order.
* Ability to configure the cycling period for automatic rank cycling.

## Capabilities
xyz.openbmc_project.PSURedundancy service will expose
xyz.openbmc_project.Control.PowerSupplyRedundancy interface & its properties.

## Limitations
If system is under maximum load and exceeds the limit of one PSU,
then both PSUs will be in active state.

## Events
When there are two PSU on the system, remove one PSU.
Then below cold redundancy events will be logged in Redfish.

Plug back the PSU, and the below cold redundancy events will be logged in
Redfish.
